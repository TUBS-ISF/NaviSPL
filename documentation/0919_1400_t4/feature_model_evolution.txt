- How did you evolve the feature model and the constraints?
	1. Added StandardZoom feature under map.
	2. moved Navigation under Route.
	3. Moved RouteDistance and dependent features under Navigation.
	4. Created alternative group under Routecalculation containing 
		vehicle modes "Car" and "Pedestrian".
	5. Created new subgroup "Services" under Core containing 
		at least one of either "Carpooling" and "Taxi".
	6. Added feature "BusStops" under Information.

- Why did you evolve the feature model (in this way)?
	1. Requirement for Pedestrian
	2. Features Car and Pedestrian refine Routecalculation. 
		Navigation only has Routecalculation as a constraint.
	3. Distance and dependent features require Navigation.
	4. To adapt the vehicle context, we need a feature for each 
		EnumLiteral, because they effect the route calculation.
	5. Carpooling and Taxi are not Information and deserve their own subgroup.
	6. Requirement for Pedestrian.
