- When did you notice the inconsistency in the product (i.e., different behavior)?
When developing the feature "RemainingTravelTime" we realized that we needed a Method to format
Time-Strings properly. There was already one in the Feature "TravelTime", that wasn't quite what 
we needed. 

- Why did this inconsistency occur?
"TravelTime" used a different Time format, that was easier to split up in Hours and Minutes. 

- How did you repair this inconsistency?
We altered the Method in the "TravelTime" Delta to fit the needs of both Features.
