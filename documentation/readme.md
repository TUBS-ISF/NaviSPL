Each evolution step documented by the project participants.
Including changed SPL artifacts (old DarwinSPL version - incompatible with new one)


**Original instructions for the project participants:**
* For each documented "case", create an own subfolder.
* In this subfolder, fill out the respective template of the template subfolder.
* Additionally, add all models, i.e., feature model, constraint, context, configurations and deltas.
* Please also maintain a "lessons learned" or "best practices" file.
