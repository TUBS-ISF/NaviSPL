- How did you evolve the feature model?
	Added feature TextToTSpeech to Information + added TTSNavi as child
	Rearranged TravelTime to parent Navigation, added ArrivalTime and DepartureTime as subfeatures.
	Renamed sNone, s112, s130 to SpeedlimitDE, SpeedlimitUK, SpeedlimitFR

- Why did you evolve the feature model (in this way)?
	TextToSpeech is a new feature, requested by the customer, the child was added to make clear that that feature only uses Navi as TTS source
	ArrivalTime and DepartureTime were requested by the customer, it felt natural to have everything centralized under the TravelTime feature
	The Speedlimit children names weren't well chosen (as the it wasn't too obvious), so we adjusted them
