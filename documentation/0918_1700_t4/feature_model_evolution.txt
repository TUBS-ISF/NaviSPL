- How did you evolve the feature model?
	Added following features to the model: Navigation, Suggestions, Routedistance, RemainingDistance, TravelTime, RemainingTravelTime, Wind, 
	H12, H24

- Why did you evolve the feature model (in this way)?
	1. Use of contextual restraints is encouraged. 
	The actual restraints will be added later, when the feature is done, because without 
	the feature they block the generation of the Variant.
	
	2. Route is an abstract feature.
