- How did you evolve the context model?
	1. Added additional context for vehicle type 'Truck'. Vehicle context selects vehicle feature, when 'Routecalculation' is active.
	2. Added constraint for 'Truck' to select 'Wind'.
	3. Extended constraints by adding timestamps to temporal validities


- Why did you evolve the context model (in this way)?
	1. Multiple vehicle types are requested. Each vehicle has their own context.
	2. 'Truck' should implicate 'Wind' by design of the feature.
	3. Timestamps necessary for validities, where a single date has multiple feature model versions.
