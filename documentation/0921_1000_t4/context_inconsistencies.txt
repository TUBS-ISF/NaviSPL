- Did your feature model or context evolution lead to inconsistent context-sensitivity (i.e., wrong configurations for certain contexts)?
	When selecting 'Routingcalculation' without a child feature, setting context as 'Truck' then reconfiguring 

		(with the given constraints):	
			
			context:Vehicle = enum:VehicleEnum.Pedestrian && Routecalculation -> Pedestrian && StandardZoom [2017/09/19T13:00:00 - eternity]
			context:Vehicle = enum:VehicleEnum.Pedestrian ->! Speedlimit [2017/09/19T13:00:00 - eternity]

			context:Vehicle = enum:VehicleEnum.Car && Routecalculation -> Car [2017/09/19T13:00:00 - eternity]
			context:Vehicle = enum:VehicleEnum.Car ->! Taxi [2017/09/19T13:00:00 - eternity]
			
			context:Vehicle = enum:VehicleEnum.Truck && Routecalculation -> Truck && Wind [2017/09/21 - eternity]
			context:Vehicle = enum:VehicleEnum.Truck -> !(BusStops || Carpooling || Taxi) [2017/09/21 - eternity]
	
- What was the wrong behavior?
	The reconfiguration did not show expected behavior (i.e. selecting 'Truck' feature, and subsequently 'Weather' and 'Wind'),
	instead removing 'Routecalculation' from the selection, and adding Favorites for whatever reason.
	This did not happen for sibling context features 'Pedestrian' and 'Car' 

- Why did it happen?
	First speculation:
	Routecalculation is not a mandatory feature. Removing it from the configuration is the smallest change possible to satisfy all constraints.

- How did you repair it?
	No fix at this point.
