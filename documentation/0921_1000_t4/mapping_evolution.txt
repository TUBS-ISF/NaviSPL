- How did you evolve the mapping?
	1. Orientation and Navigation lead to navigation rotation delta being selected.
	2. Moved mapping elements around to improve visibility.

- Why did you evolve the mapping (in this way)?
	1. Due to problems with the underlying mapviewer (mouse click 
		location warped when map is rotated), Orientation is split into two deltas;
		one for manual map rotation, resetting on mouse click; one for rotating map
		according to current movement of the navigation system.
		The latter will be selected, when both Navigation and Orientation are selected.
		This will be implemented in a future merge.
	2. large amount of mappings are difficult to read, when not sorted.
