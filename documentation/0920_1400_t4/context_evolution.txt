- How did you evolve the context model?
	1. Added new constraint: "Navigation" -> "Routecalculation".
	2. Extended constraints for time format to require Time feature selected.

- Why did you evolve the context model (in this way)?
	1. Navigation is useless without a calculated route.
	2. Time format should not be set, if Time is not set as a feature.
		Otherwise, time would always be set when building a configuration.
