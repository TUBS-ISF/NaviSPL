- When did you notice the inconsistency in the product (i.e., different behavior)?
When creating the deltas for our feature, we realized that accessing certain JButtons was not possible
since they were only contained within a method and not exposed to the containing class.

- Why did this inconsistency occur?
Accessing the JButtons from outside that method was not needed at the moment they were created

- How did you repair this inconsistency?
We altered the creating delta

(If this documentation page is lacking sense, ask Adrian... We don't quite know how to express this on point)
