- How did you evolve the context model?
	Added constraints for Kilometer and Mile


- Why did you evolve the context model (in this way)?
	Distance requires to be changed based on the location, therefore the following constraints were added
	We refrained from using another ContextEnum for the distance location as otherwise you might have to select the location several times.
