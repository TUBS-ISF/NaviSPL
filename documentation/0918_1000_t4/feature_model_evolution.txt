- How did you evolve the feature model?
	1. Created children for Speedlimit, to be used with contextual restraints.
	
	2. Made children of Route into an OR - Group.

- Why did you evolve the feature model (in this way)?
	1. Use of contextual restraints is encouraged. 
	The actual restraints will be added later, when the feature is done, because without 
	the feature they block the generation of the Variant.
	
	2. Route is an abstract feature.
