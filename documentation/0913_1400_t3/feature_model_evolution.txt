- How did you evolve the feature model?
1.Added two children (24Hours, 12Hours) as alternative group to Time.
2. Added constraint for Germany, France and GB to enforce matching time system.


- Why did you evolve the feature model (in this way)?
1. Context requires two different time formats.
2. In GB the only time system option should be 12Hours, in France and Germany the only time system option should be 24Hours.
